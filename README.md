This program is a random quote generator.  It uses JavaScript and HTML to pull random quotes from a string and display them onto the html live server.  The quote can be refreshed and changed by clicking the "new quote" button, which then it uses the onclick function and Math.Floor and Math.Random to pull from the quotes array and display them onto the live server
